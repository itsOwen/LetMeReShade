## üöÄ Installation

### ReShade Installation

1. **Download the Latest Release:**  
   Grab the latest version from the releases section.
2. **Extract Files:**  
   Unzip the archive and place the contents into `homebrew/plugins/<LetMeReShade-folder>`.
3. **Restart Your Steam Deck:**  
   This completes the installation.
4. **Note on Conflicts:**  
   ReShade conflicts with FGMOD (due to shared DLL files). To switch, uninstall or unpatch one before enabling the other.

### VkBasalt Configuration

1. **Configure VkBasalt:**  
   Edit (or create) the `vkBasalt.conf` file, usually located at `~/.config/vkBasalt/vkBasalt.conf`, with the following settings:
   ```conf
   # Enable effects (comma-separated)
   effects = cas:denoise

   # Path configurations
   reshade_effect_paths = path here
   reshade_texture_paths = path here
   reshade_include_paths = path here

   # Effect parameters
   [cas]
   sharpness = 0.65

   [denoise]
   radius = 2
   ```
2. **Custom Shader Placement:**  
   - **For ReShade:** Place `.fx` files in `~/.local/share/reshade/shaders/`.
   - **For VkBasalt:** Place `.fx` files in `~/.config/reshade/Shaders/`.
3. **Adding Custom Effects:**  
   Append your custom shader names (without the `.fx` extension) to the `effects` line:
   ```conf
   effects = your_custom_effect
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Access the Plugin:**  
   Open the Quick Access Menu and navigate to the LetMeReShade plugin.
2. **Select Engine:**  
   Choose the appropriate installation based on your game:
   - Click **"Install ReShade"** for DirectX/OpenGL titles.
   - Click **"Install VkBasalt"** for Vulkan-based games.
3. **Overlay Access:**  
   Launch your game and press the **HOME** key to access the in-game overlay for shader adjustments.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Overlay Not Appearing**
   - Verify that the correct DLL override is selected (for ReShade) or that Vulkan launch settings are properly configured (for VkBasalt).
   - VkBasalt doesn't have a menu like ReShade.
   - Confirm the **HOME** key is correctly mapped.
   - Ensure that the game supports the selected enhancement engine.

2. **Game Crashes on Launch**
   - Try using an alternative DLL override (manual patching options coming soon).
   - Check shader compatibility and game support for ReShade or VkBasalt.

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Disable resource-intensive shaders.
   - Confirm you are running the latest version of the plugin and shader repositories.

## Manual Patching

So here is a guide to using manual patching of ReShade, since the plugin doesn't work on Stardew Valley out of the box.  I checked the game folder and found that it downloads the Linux version of Stardew Valley on the Steam Deck.  Here's what I did:

I was able to run ReShade on Stardew Valley on my Steam Deck (Steam game).

Here's what you need to do:

1. Install the latest version of my LetMeReShade plugin.
2. Uninstall Stardew Valley.
3. Go to Stardew Valley's properties/compatibility and check "Force Compatibility" and select Proton Experimental.
4. Now the Windows version of the game will be installed.
5. Now open LetMeReShade, and below you will see "Manual Patching." Select the game, select the DLL (OpenGL), click "Apply Patch," and confirm. (I found out from a Youtube video that I need openGL instead of DX so I will recommend you to watch some youtube videos if the reshade isn't working for you)
6. Now download Fadedew and place it in the Stardew Valley folder.
7. Now enjoy.
